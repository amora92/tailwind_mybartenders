# Secrets scanning configuration
# The scanner flags certain environment variable values that appear in source code.
# The following env vars contain public contact information (email addresses)
# and service hostnames that are intentionally used in the website source code.
# They are NOT secrets and should be excluded from the scan:
# - EMAIL_TO: Public business contact email displayed on the website
# - CONTACT_FORM_BCC: Business email for form submission copies
# - ZOHO_SMTP_HOST: Standard SMTP service hostname (smtp.zoho.eu)
# - ZOHO_SMTP_USER: SMTP username (uses same email as public contact email)
